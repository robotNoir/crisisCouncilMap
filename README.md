# Interactive Map for Crisis Councils

Project Aims:
- to create a central repository for the common code and any geography files for the use in crisis councils

Notes:
- hosting has always been achieved via Google, with Sheets acting as an interactive backend for the hub/directors: thus, intergration with this is needed in order for the map to function
